# Build and Install

Have a look at the [INSTALL](./INSTALL.md) file to build and install the provider.

# Usage

We created some demo folders to test `OP_DID` and `OP_VC` operations singularly and to perform SSI TLS handshakes: 
- `did-demos` directory contains demo applications to test `OP_DID`.
- `vc-demos` directory contains demo applications to test `OP_VC`.
- `ssi-tls-hs-demos` directory contains scripts that employ a new version of `s_client` and `s_server` applications to perform SSI-authenticated handshakes.
